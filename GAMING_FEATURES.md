## 📊 Reaper Distance Formula

getReaperDistance(score) {
  if (score >= 0) return 100;  // Safe - far away
  const level = Math.abs(score);
  if (level >= 10) return 0;   // Eliminated - at player
  return 100 - (level * 10);   // 10% closer per -1 point
}
```

**Example:**
- Score 0: Reaper at 100% distance (far)
- Score -3: Reaper at 70% distance
- Score -7: Reaper at 30% distance (DANGER!)
- Score -10: Reaper at 0% distance (DEATH!)
